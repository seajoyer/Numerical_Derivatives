* Homework on Numerical Derivatives

This project implements Numerical Derivatives in C++ and Python, providing such functionality:

- First left derivative
- First right derivative
- First central derivative
- First asymmetric derivative
- Second central derivative with 2nd accuracy
- Second central derivative with 4th accuracy

An example for a function by 5 nodes:

$$
f(x) = \cosh\left( \exp(-x^2) \right), \quad x \in [-5, 5]
$$

** Building C++

*** For Nix users

This project comes with a flake, for those lucky Nix users to build and run the C++ implementation it's enough to execute:
#+begin_src shell
nix run github:seajoyer/Numerical_Derivatives#cpp --impure
#+end_src shell
Replace ~#cpp~ with ~#py~ to run the Python program.

You can also start an isolated development shell with all the dependencies by simply running:
#+begin_src shell
nix develop github:seajoyer/Numerical_Derivatives
#+end_src shell

*** Manually

**** Prerequisites

First, install dependencies, this is done differently in different systems:

- [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][g++]] compiler
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download][Make]] build system
- [[http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html][Gnuplot]] plotting program

**** Building & Running

1. Clone the repository:
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/seajoyer/Numerical_Derivatives
   cd Numerical_Derivatives/cpp
   #+end_src shell
2. And once you are ready:
   #+begin_src shell
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   #+end_src

** Running Python

*** For Nix users

To run the python program, execute:

#+begin_src shell
nix run github:seajoyer/Numerical_Derivatives#py --impure
#+end_src shell

To enter the isolated development shell with installed Python and necessary libs:
#+begin_src shell
nix develop github:seajoyer/Numerical_Derivatives
#+end_src shell

*** Manually

**** Prerequisites

- Python itself
- NumPy library
- SymPy library
- Matplotlib library
- tqdm library

Install them to your system.

**** Running

1. Clone the repo if haven't yet
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/seajoyer/Numerical_Derivatives
   cd Numerical_Derivatives/py
   #+end_src shell
2. Then just execute:
   #+begin_src shell
   python3 demo.py
   #+end_src shell
