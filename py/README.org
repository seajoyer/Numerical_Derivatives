* Numerical Derivatives Library

This library provides functions for numerical computation of first and second derivatives
using various methods, including left, right, central, and asymmetric differences,
as well as higher-order approximations. It also includes functionality for plotting
comparisons between numerical and analytical derivatives.

** Installation

#+begin_src shell
pip install .
#+end_src

** Usage

Basic usage for computing derivatives:

#+begin_src python
from numerical_derivatives import first_derivative_central
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return np.sin(x)

x = 1.0
h = 0.01
derivative = first_derivative_central(f, x, h)
print(f"The approximate derivative of sin(x) at x=1 is: {derivative}")
#+end_src

Plotting comparison between numerical and analytical derivatives:

#+begin_src python
from numerical_derivatives import plot_derivatives_comparison
from numerical_derivatives.utils import f

plot_derivatives_comparison(f, (-5, 5), 0.01, num_der_func)
#+end_src
